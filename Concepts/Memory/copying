#Deep Copying vs Shallow Copying
#Shallow Copy - The copy process does not recurse. 
#Deep Copy - Does a full recursive copy resulting in an independent clone. Copying is slower. 
#Shallow copying becomes a problem when trying to copy more complex collections 

import copy as c

list1 = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
print("original list", list1)

#Shallow copy
list1Shallow = c.copy(list1)
print("Shallow copy", list1Shallow)

#Deep Copy
list1Deep = c.deepcopy(list1)
print("Deep copy", list1Deep)

#Make change to the lists
list1[0][1] = "Change"
print("original list>>>>", list1)
print("Shallow copy>>>>", list1Shallow)
print("Deep copy>>>>", list1Deep)
